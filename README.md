CV recreated as an interative web application made with React

live at https://ethanwatsonreactcv.herokuapp.com/

Select a category to view information on different aspects of my professional profile.
Different CSS templates can be chosen in the top right corner of the page, including a standard piece of paper style, an old papyrus scroll style and a CRT television monitor style.

The code can be viewed via the 'view code' button in the top right, which will flip the view to give options for different files to view. 
These files are requested to the page via an Express web service acting on the back end of the application.
Otherwise the code is also visible here on github.
